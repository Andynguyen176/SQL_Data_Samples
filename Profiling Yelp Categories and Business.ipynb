In contrast to other fields in the business data which are free text\nsuch that a business or reviewer adding a business can enter any value (e.g., city name), for categories a business\ncan only select from a predefined list.  Since it is a fixed list, it is referred \nto as a \"controlled vocabulary\" because the values anyone can enter are controlled.\n\nThe category vocabulary is provided at [this URL](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/all_category_list) which \nis part of Yelp's Fusion API (that apps can use to access Yelp data).  You will see that there are some categories that \nare at the top level (such as *Active Life* which starts the list) and others are indented as child categories (such as\n*Amusement Parks* which is indented under Active Life).  \n\nA list of all of the categories and their parent-child relationships can be downloaded from the above linked page, but\ninstead of the format used for the Yelp data, this file has JSON in a pretty printed format, so the JSON entry\nfor each category spans multiple lines.  In Spark version 2.2.1 there is a multi-line option that would allow us to read \nthis directly, but currently we are using Spark 2.1.  Instead, we converted the file to a single line for each \ncategory as a JSON object and loaded that into DSX.\n\nIn the following cell, insert the boilerplate for the categories.json file (zipped as a .bz2 file) by selecting \n`Insert SparkSession DataFrame` from the `Insert to code` option for that file.

This is also the value used in the `parents` field to identify the parent-child relationships in the categry hierarchy.\n* country_blacklist:  A category may have a white list or black list, but not both.  This field is either a list of 2-digit country codes or null. if this field contains a list of country codes, then the category can be used in any country except those in the list.  For example, the cuisine \"Afghan\" has the blacklist \\[MX, TR\\], which means this category is not used in Mexico or Turkey.\n* country_whitelist:  If there is a list in this field, the category only is used in those countries.  For example, the category \"Absinthe Bars\", which is a sub-category under \"Bars\" has a whitelist with one country \\[CZ\\] which is the Czech Republic.  This category will only be used to describe businesses in that country.\n* parents: The categories form a hierarchy, so the broader parent category above each category is a list in this field.  although most categories have one parent category, there are a few with multiple parent categories in the list.  If the list is empty \\[ \\] for a category (such as \"Active Life\"), then the category is a top-level category and there is no parent category.\n* title:  This is the human-readable label for the category and is also the label included in the list of categories for a business in the `categories` field in the Yelp business data.\n\n\n",

For those that do, how many parents do they have?\n* We want to determine the hierarchy for the categories - how deep does it go?\n* What are the top-level categories and how many are there? \n* How many categories have a whitelist and how many include the U.S. or Canada?\n* How many categories have a blacklist, and how many include the U.S., or Canada (and how many include both)?\n\n### Multiple parent categories\nWe will start our profiling with determining the number of categories with multiple parents.\n\nIn relational databases values should be atomic.  What this means is that the value for each column\nin a row should contain a single value.  For example, if categories had multiple parents, there would be a separate table that \ncontains that relationship.  Why not just have another row?  Database normalization - you want to avoid duplicate values.\nIn a relational world, this is important.  In part this is to maintain data integrity - if you have multiple rows for a category\nbecause it has multiple parents, and you update the alias for one row and not the other, now you have a problem.\n\nIn Big Data (such as on Spark), columns can contain arrays (also known as lists), or maps (also known as dictionaries, or objects in JSON).\nSimilar to functions you can use with numeric or string columns in a DataFrame/temporary view, there are functions you can use in your SQL queries\nwith array and map fields.  One of these functions is `SIZE()`, which returns the size of an array.  For the parents field, we are most interested\n(at least in our initial profiling) in those categories with multiple parents or no parents.\n\nRun the following cell to find out how many categories have multiple parents.  Since we first just want to know the answer, \nthere is no need to save the DataFrame generated (which in this case will be a DataFrame with 1 column and one row).",

            "source": "### Flagging Businesses as Being in Certain Categories\n\nThe categories for a business are an array in the business data.  Later we will figure out the hierachy of the categories so we can match them up with the business data, \nbut we want to flatten the category data, so if a business has the following categories (such as Alize Catering in Toronto):\n\n\\[Italian, French, Restaurants\\]\n\nWe want to see three rows in the result with all of the data repeated, but each of the categories on a separate line.\n\nHowever, depending on our question, we may want to first flag certain businesses as being in a specific top-level category.  Why is this?  Well, if we flatten the data for Alize Catering\nbut then want to know if the business is a restaurant, it becomes a little more tricky.  If we add a new column to \"flag\" Alize Catering as a restaurant, then all three lines for Alize Catering\nafter we flatten the data will contain that same value.\n\nIn Yelp's 10K, Restaurants and Shopping are identified \nas the two most common categories, so lets flag if a business is in either of those categories.  We will also flag Nightlife and Food.  There are a number of ways we could do this, but we \nwill add a column for each of these, so we will add four columns that have a Boolean value (True or False):\n\n* is_shopping\n* is_restaurants\n* is_food\n* is_nightlife\n\nTo do this, we will use another array function: `ARRAY_CONTAINS(<column>, <value>)`  Which returns a Boolean value. So to check for shopping we would include the following in our select:\n\n`ARRAY_CONTAINS(categories, \"Shopping\") AS is_shopping`\n\nLooking at the top categories we identified earlier, there are two that you may wonder if they ever occur by themselves or always with another top level category:\n\n* Local Flavor\n* Local Services\n\nFor these two categories, instead of having separate columns, let's have one column named \"is_local\" that has the following values:\n\n* 0 = neither local flavor nor local service\n* 1 = local flavor, but not local service\n* 2 = local service, but not local flavor\n* 3 = both local flavor and local service\n\nWe can use the `ARRAY_CONTAINS()` function, but it's getting a bit more complicated.  In a prior exercise we used the `IF()` function, but with our 4 possible values, \nthat starts to get messy, so we will use the `CASE` function which works well for multiple conditions.  The syntax of the CASE function is as follows:\n\n`\nCASE\n    WHEN ARRAY_CONTAINS(categories, \"Local Flavor\") AND ARRAY_CONTAINS(categories, \"Local Services\") THEN 3\n    WHEN ARRAY_CONTAINS(categories, \"Local Flavor\") THEN 1\n    WHEN ARRAY_CONTAINS(categories, \"Local Services\") THEN 2\n    ELSE 0\nEND AS is_local\n`\n\nThe entire `CASE` function, from the `CASE` at the start to the `END` is calculating the value of a single column in the `SELECT` clause.  We then give that column the alias \"is_local\".  \nYou may be wondering why the `THEN` results within the CASE function are not in numerical order, but the way this function works is that it starts at the top and keeps testing the `WHEN` conditions.\n When some condition is true, the corresponding `THEN` value is the result for that row of the data.  If none of the `WHEN` conditions is true, the `ELSE` value at the end is the default result.\n\n### Let's put this all together\n\nThe query in the following cell includes the function calls for is_shopping and is_restaurants, but you need to add the two lines for the is_food and is_nightlife columns:",

To do this there is a function named `EXPLODE()` that will take a column contianing an array or map and flatten it out to create new rows.\nWhen flattening data using `EXPLODE()`, keep in mind that each query can only explode one column.\n\n**NOTE:** When using `EXPLODE()`, if a row contains null in the exploded column, it **WILL NOT** be included in the result.  There is an `EXPLODE_OUTER()` function that will retain\nthe row with the original null value, but that was added in version 2.3 of Spark (and currently DSX is on version 2.1 of Spark).  Later in this notebook we show a way that could be used to get around this\nby combining multiple SELECT clauses in a query using a UNION.\n\nTo flatten the categories field from the df_business_top_categories DataFrame you created above, we first need to create a new temporary view, which we name \"business_cat\" in the \ncell below.\n\n#### What you need to add: \nIn that cell, after the line that creates the new temporary view, add a query that selects each field from \"business_cat\" (these are the same columns that are in the DataFrame it's built on).\nIn this query you cannot use the asterisk \\* to select all of the columns, but will instead need to list them.  The reason is that instead of the \"categories\" column you need to add the following \n`EXPLODE()` function call:\n\n`\nEXPLODE(categories) AS category\n`\n\nAssign the result of the query to a new DataFrame named `df_flattened_business`, and then show the DataFrame as you did above.",

We need to assign single parents in these cases so we can build a hierarchy (referred to a tree, but obviously by someone who does \nnot live near Yosemite since the tree is upside down).\n\nFor some of these 16 categories, a parent choice might be more obvious, such as for the \"Hotels\" category the two parents are \"eventservices\" and \"hotelstravel\".  In this case \n\"hotelstravel\" seems like it may be a more suitable parent.\n\nSince we have only 16 of these multi-parent categories, we will create a new DataFrame named \"df_single_parent\" using a case statement.\n\nIn the following blank cell create a Spark SQL query that includes all of the columns in the categories temporary view you created earlier, but instead of the \nlist currently in the parents column, your query result should have a \"parent\" column (not plural), that has the parent assigned to each category.  For the `SELECT` clause,\nyou should have the new \"parent\" column last instead of the \"title\" column.\n\nYou have 1,539 categories, but only 16 of them need a parent assigned, so the first `WHEN` condition in your case statement should check for the situation\nwhere there is a single parent - that occurs when the SIZE(parents) is 1.  In that case, the `THEN` result for that case is to get the first item in that array.\nThe first element is in the 0th position, so the `THEN` for this case would be `parents[0]`\n\nThe second `WHEN` in your `CASE` function needs to address the top-level categories that have no parents, their \"parents\" array is empty: \\[ \\], so when \nthe `SIZE(parents) = 0`  the `THEN` result is `NULL`, meaning there is no value:\n\n`\nWHEN SIZE(parents) = 0 THEN NULL\n`\n\nAfter you run your query, show a count of your DataFrame and show the first few rows.  \nYou should have the same number of rows you started with and the following columns (in this order):\n\nalias, country_blacklist, country_whitelist, title, parent\n\nAfter you have the query running, you may want to try adding the followng `WHERE` clause just to test your `CASE` function (but be sure to then remove \nthe `WHERE` clause and rerun the query so the result has all 1,539 rows again).\n\n`WHERE SIZE(parents) > 1`",

For example, all restaurant cuisine categories\nare under the top-level \"Restaurants\" category in the Yelp hierarchy.  However, some cuisines break down into lower level sub-categories.  For example,\nthe category \"Caribbean\" has four subcategories: Dominican, Haitian, Puerto Rican, and Trinidadian.  If a restaurant has \"Haitian\" as a category, the \nYelp data for that business will automatically include all of the parent categories up to the top, so it will have \\[Haitian, Caribbean, Restaurants\\].  If\nyou are splitting restaurants between cuisines, you will want to use the second level categories (e.g., Caribbean) and omit the lower level categories.\n\nIn the following cell we do a transformation that creates a new DataFrame named `df_category_hierarchy` that is the `df_single_parent` DataFrame with a `level`\ncolumn added that indicates how far down in the hierarchy each category is.  The top-level categories (such as Restaurants or Shopping) are `level` = 1.\n\n#### What the followng cell is doing\n\nSince DataFrames and temporary views based on them are immutable (cannot be updated), we do a loop through the ierarchy, starting at the top level\nand adding each level as we identify the children categories of the last level added.\n\nAt the start, the `df_category_hierarchy` DataFrame is populated with the 22 top-level categories that do not have a parent (their parent is null).\nIn each loop through the while statement (which is plain old Python), the following happens:\n* The current size of the hierachy is calculated as the variable `before`.  In the first loop this is 22, the number of top-level categories\n* A temporary view named `hierarchy` is created based on the current `df_category_hierarchy` DataFrame\n* The query is a UNION of two SELECT statements:\n    1. The current content of the `df_category_hierarchy` DataFrame\n    2. The INNER JOIN of rows in the hierarchy that are at the parent level (so we don't keep adding the levels already added) with the child categories that have those categories as their parent\n* The result of the UNION is assigned to the `df_category_hierarchy` DataFrame and we calculate how many records were added\n* We stop looping when no new records are added (it means we reached the bottom of the hierarchy)\n\nIn the UNION, the number of columns must match.  Conceptually,you can think of this as if you had a spreadsheet with the 22 rows containing the \ntop-level categories and then you appended the rows for the second-level categories that had those top-level categories as parents, and then \nyou appended rows for the next level, and so on.",
